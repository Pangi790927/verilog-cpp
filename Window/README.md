# Window
Window that works on windows and linux

alt and some other keys do not work on windows
multiple windows inheritance is broken on linux

the keys are best described in keyboard.h ascii keys can be used as ascii keys if you want to use 'w' as 'W' and the reverse you must check for both, they have different keys
